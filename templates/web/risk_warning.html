            Risk Warning
        </h2>
        <p>At Morfin Fx, we value transparency and client education. Please read this Risk Warning carefully before
            engaging in any trading activities. Investing in Contract for Difference (CFD) products carries a high
            degree of risk. The leverage often obtainable in CFD trading means that even a small market movement can
            result in a proportionately larger movement in the value of your investment. This can work both for and
            against you.</p>
        <p>It is vital to understand the potential risks associated with trading CFDs, including the possibility of
            losing more than your initial deposit. The following information provides an overview of the risks involved
            in investment products available through our services.</p>
        <p>Note: CFD - Contract For Differences</p>

        <h2 class="content_title">
            Understanding the Risks:</h2>
        <p>Gearing and Leverage: CFDs offer the potential for significant gains, but they also introduce the risk of
            substantial losses. The leverage inherent in CFD trading can amplify market movements, leading to rapid
            changes in the value of your investment.</p>
        <p>Margin Calls: A volatile market can necessitate additional funds with little or no notice. Failure to meet
            margin requirements may result in the closure of your positions, potentially incurring significant losses.
        </p>
        <p>Losses Beyond Your Deposit: It is possible to lose more money than you have initially deposited into your
            trading account. You should be prepared for such scenarios and only invest funds you can afford to lose.</p>
        <p>Informed Decision-Making: You must take responsibility for understanding and managing the risks associated
            with CFD trading. This includes having adequate financial resources to handle potential losses and seeking
            professional advice when necessary.</p>

        <h2 class="content_title">

            Your Responsibility:</h2>

            monitor your positions and be prepared to take appropriate actions.</p>
